    "df['text'] = ['''In recent times, the emergence of advanced Large Language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard has remarkably enhanced the quality of artificially generated text, blurring the lines between synthetic and human-written content. However, this progress has some significant concerns across ethical, moral, legal, social, and economic realms in various industries. To overcome these concerns, our study introduces a method designed to detect the synthetically generated text (SGT) and human-written text (HWT).\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this Machine Learning model, first we require both synthetic and manually written text data for comparison purposes. We are going to include dataset from Kaggle (JONATHAN HERRERA Augmented data for LLM - Detect AI Generated Text). The data set is in raw form which contains two columns text and label, in label 1 indicates AI generated and 0 indicates human written. We need to clean the dataset by filling missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once our dataset is ready, we will use NLP-based feature extraction to compare the features of the synthetic and human-generated data, This work is doing before training our Machine Learning model. When working with datasets for NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks, it is very important to carry out feature engineering. This involves using similar techniques for datasets to gain a better understanding of their patterns and characteristics. We have to create basic NLP-related features like word count, punctuation usage, title presence, and the way characters are written (like uppercase or lowercase). TD-IDF-related features, N-gram features, topic modeling features, readability scores, named entity recognition (NER) counts, and text error length features. To determine the best set of features, we use principal component analysis (PCA). These features will be useful in classifying the datasets. To find an optimal set of features, principal component analysis is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to differentiate between HWT (Hand written text) and SGT (Synthetic generated text), we need to take help from Machine Learning algorithms. We need to employed classifiers algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and XGBoost (XGB) to perform the classification for identifying either human-written or ChatGPT generated text based on the collected handcrafted features. Our models were trained, fine-tuned, and tested using the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We used Precision, Recall, and F1 scores as metrics to evaluate and compare the performance our model. The whole model is deployed with the web interface by using Django Framework.''']"
